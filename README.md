# Machines
Manage machine inventories.

This is a React Native application, designed to efficiently manage machine inventories. It offers two different User Interface designs: One utilizing the Material UI framework and the other using native React Native components. This flexibility allows easy targeting of low and medium performing devices which may have limited resources to perform optimally with the Material UI components overload.

The application enables an efficient organization of machine categories within an inventory. Each machine category may have a list of shared properties that are applicable to all machines within that category. 

Key Features:
1. Machine Category Management: create, edit, and delete machine categories, defining shared properties for each category.
2. Machine Member Management: add, modify, and remove individual machine members within each category, assigning specific values to the shared properties.
3. User-Friendly Interface: The application provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface, ensuring easy navigation and seamless interaction for inventory management tasks.
4. Material UI Approach: With the Material UI framework, the app follows modern design principles and provides a visually appealing and consistent user interface.
5. Native React Native Components Approach: a simpler outlook that leverages React Native's native components to maximise efficiency and performance on low end devices.
